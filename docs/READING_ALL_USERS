The MAGIC of leveraging all the functionality in JPARepository Extension on our UserRepository interface

How it works, conventionally:
    |-->    Have Controllers, which intercept requests, they send off a flow of code
            |-->    to the Service
                    |-->    Service talks to the Repositories

this is the flow, do not jump jump the gun & skip from Controller to the Repository
we want the code inside Controller to only be the Controller related stuff
in essence, we want to separate our concerns
if the Controller talks to the Repository, what happens there,
the implication is that the Controller will start to do more Service oriented behavior
and Controller is not where we should put Service oriented behavior
Service oriented behavior in programming should be in a Service class
okay, again, separate our concerns

having said that & the reason why it's brought up is bcuz ...
we need to create a UserService class next
and let's put it in the .service package, so to give it its own distinction
